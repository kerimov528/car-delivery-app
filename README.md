# üöó **Front-end JS Engineer Test Assessment - Car Dealer App**

## üìã **Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of the **Car Dealer App** using **Next.js**. The app allows users to filter cars based on vehicle type and model year, and view the results on a separate page.

## ‚úÖ **Steps Completed**

### 1. **Create a Next.js Application**

I created a new Next.js application using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest car-dealer-app
```

After the app was set up, I installed necessary dependencies such as Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 2. Create the Filter Page

### üé® Designing the Filter Page:
- The filter page is set as the home page of the app (`pages/index.js`).
- I used Tailwind CSS to style the page, ensuring a clean and responsive UI. I created input fields for vehicle make and model year selectors.

### Adding Vehicle Makes and Model Year Selectors:
- I fetched vehicle makes from the following API endpoint:

```bash
https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/GetMakesForVehicleType/car?format=json
```

## 3. Create the Result Page

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementing `generateStaticParams`:
- I defined the `generateStaticParams` function inside `pages/result/[makeId]/[year].js` to pre-render the result pages based on the available vehicle makes and model years.
- The paths are dynamically generated using data from the vehicle makes and model years.

### üõ† Fetching Vehicle Data:
- On the result page, I used Next.js dynamic routing to access the vehicle `makeId` and `year` from the URL parameters.
- I fetched the corresponding vehicle models from the following endpoint:

```bash
https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/GetModelsForMakeIdYear/makeId/{makeId}/modelyear/{year}?format=json
```

## 4. Implement Suspense Component

- I implemented React‚Äôs Suspense component to handle loading states for the vehicle models on the result page.
- Suspense was used to delay the rendering of the results until the data is successfully fetched.

## 5. Implement UI with Tailwind CSS

- I styled all pages and components using Tailwind CSS.
- I made sure the UI was responsive across devices and followed accessibility best practices (e.g., aria labels for dropdowns, focus management for accessibility).


## 6. Add Configuration and Documentation

### Environment Variables:

### Setup ESLint and Prettier:
- I added ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency.
- Configured `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc` files to follow best practices.

### Creating the README File:
- I wrote this `README.md` file to provide a comprehensive overview of the project and how to set it up and run it locally.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kerimov528/car-delivery-app

cd car-dealer-app

npm install

npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js for building the React app and server-side rendering.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- React Suspense for handling data fetching and loading states.
